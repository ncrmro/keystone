# Convention: Project Board (process.project-board)

This convention defines how project boards (Kanban boards) are created, populated, and maintained to track milestone progress.

## Board Lifecycle

1. One project board MUST exist per milestone.
2. The board MUST be created when the milestone is set up.
3. The board MUST be closed or archived when the milestone is closed.

## Standard Columns

4. Every board MUST use these five columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Backlog | Issue exists, not yet prioritized |
| To Do | Prioritized and ready to pick up |
| In Progress | Branch created, active work |
| In Review | Non-draft PR open, review requested |
| Done | Issue closed / PR merged |

## Transition Rules

5. Issues MUST progress through columns as work advances. The mechanism depends on the platform:

| Event | From → To | GitHub | Forgejo |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Issue added to milestone | → Backlog | Agent: `gh project item-add` + set status | Manual: web UI |
| Issue prioritized for work | Backlog → To Do | Agent: `gh project item-edit` | Manual: web UI |
| Branch created, work starts | To Do → In Progress | Agent: `gh project item-edit` | Manual: web UI |
| PR marked ready for review | In Progress → In Review | Agent: `gh project item-edit` | Manual: web UI |
| PR merged / issue closed | → Done | **Automatic** (built-in workflow) | Manual: web UI |

6. Agents MUST NOT duplicate automatic transitions — if the platform handles a transition, the agent MUST NOT also fire it.

## GitHub Built-in Automations

7. GitHub Projects V2 includes three default workflows that MAY be enabled:
   - **Item closed** → status set to Done (enabled by default)
   - **PR merged** → status set to Done (enabled by default)
   - **Auto-add** → items from linked repos auto-added (configurable)

8. Agents SHOULD enable the "Item closed" and "PR merged" workflows when creating a new board.
9. Agents SHOULD enable the "Auto-add" workflow and configure it for the milestone's repository.

## GitHub CLI Reference

10. The `project` scope MUST be granted before using project commands: `gh auth refresh -s project`.

11. Board creation and management commands:

```bash
# Create board
gh project create --owner {owner} --title "{Milestone}" --format json

# Link to repo
gh project link {number} --owner {owner} --repo {owner}/{repo}

# Get field/option IDs (needed for status changes)
gh project field-list {number} --owner {owner} --format json

# Add item
gh project item-add {number} --owner {owner} --url {issue_url} --format json

# Change status (requires project-id, field-id, option-id)
gh project item-edit --id {item-id} --project-id {project-id} \
  --field-id {status-field-id} --single-select-option-id {option-id}

# List items
gh project item-list {number} --owner {owner} --format json

# View project
gh project view {number} --owner {owner} --format json
```

12. The status field ID and option IDs MUST be looked up via `gh project field-list` before setting statuses. These IDs are project-specific and MUST NOT be hardcoded.

## Forgejo Limitations

13. Forgejo 14.0.2 has **no project board REST API** (verified against the swagger spec).
14. Boards are managed via web UI only at `https://{host}/{owner}/{repo}/projects`.
15. Agents MUST document board URLs in milestone or issue descriptions for easy access.
16. When Forgejo adds project board API support, this section SHOULD be updated.

## Doctor Checklist

17. Every milestone issue MUST have a corresponding board item.
18. Closed issues MUST be in the Done column.
19. Issues with open draft PRs SHOULD be in In Progress.
20. Issues with non-draft PRs and requested reviewers SHOULD be in In Review.
21. Issues with no associated PR SHOULD be in Backlog or To Do.
