# Convention: CLI Coding Agents (tool.cli-coding-agents)

## Overview

Keystone provisions four CLI coding agents via `keystone.terminal.enable`:
**Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Codex**, and **OpenCode**. Each tool has
its own instruction file format, discovery paths, and MCP configuration.
This convention documents the correct paths, naming, and nuances for each
tool so that keystone modules generate the right files in the right places.

Keystone also maintains a canonical user-level instruction file at
`~/.keystone/AGENTS.md`. Tool-native files are generated from that same content.

## Instruction File Paths

Each tool discovers project and user-level instruction files at specific
paths. Keystone MUST generate instruction files at these paths so each
tool loads conventions natively (without prompt injection).

### Claude Code

- **Docs**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#claudemd-files
- **File name**: `CLAUDE.md`
- **User-level**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — personal preferences for all projects
- **Project-level**: `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` — team-shared, checked into source control
- **Managed policy** (org-wide): `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` (Linux)
- **Path-scoped rules**: `.claude/rules/*.md` — loaded when Claude reads matching files (supports `paths:` frontmatter glob patterns)
- **Imports**: `@path/to/file.md` syntax, relative to the file containing the import, max 5 hops
- **Size guidance**: Target under 200 lines per file; longer files reduce adherence
- **MCP config**: `~/.claude.json` — MCP server configs (deepwork, chrome-devtools, grafana, process-compose)
- **Auto memory**: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md` — Claude writes this itself; first 200 lines loaded per session

**Keystone generates**:

- `~/.keystone/AGENTS.md` — canonical Keystone instruction file for the user profile
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — system-wide conventions from `keystone-conventions` derivation
- `~/.claude.json` — MCP server configs (deepwork, chrome-devtools, grafana, process-compose)
- `.claude/rules/` — not generated (project-specific, not keystone's concern)

### Gemini CLI

- **Docs**: https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/gemini-md/
- **File name**: `GEMINI.md` (default; configurable via `settings.json`)
- **User-level**: `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` — global instructions for all projects
- **Project-level**: `GEMINI.md` in workspace directories and parent directories
- **JIT context**: `GEMINI.md` files auto-scanned in accessed directories up to trusted root
- **Imports**: `@file.md` syntax for both relative and absolute paths
- **Memory commands**: `/memory show`, `/memory reload`, `/memory add <text>`
- **MCP config**: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- **Configurable filenames**: `settings.json` → `context.fileName` array can include `["AGENTS.md", "CONTEXT.md", "GEMINI.md"]`

**Keystone generates**:

- `~/.keystone/AGENTS.md` — canonical Keystone instruction file for the user profile
- `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` — system-wide conventions from `keystone-conventions` derivation
- `~/.gemini/settings.json` — MCP server configs + context settings

### Codex (OpenAI)

- **Docs**: https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md
- **File name**: `AGENTS.md` (primary); `AGENTS.override.md` takes precedence
- **User-level**: `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (or `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md`)
- **Project-level**: `AGENTS.md` in each directory from git root to CWD; at most one file per directory
- **Override**: `AGENTS.override.md` checked before `AGENTS.md` in every location
- **Fallback filenames**: Configurable in `~/.codex/config.toml` via `project_doc_fallback_filenames`
- **Size limit**: Combined instructions cap at 32 KiB by default (`project_doc_max_bytes`)
- **Merge order**: Files concatenate root → CWD; closer directories override earlier guidance
- **Profile switching**: `CODEX_HOME=$(pwd)/.codex codex exec "command"`

**Keystone generates**:

- `~/.keystone/AGENTS.md` — canonical Keystone instruction file for the user profile
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` — system-wide conventions (note: Codex calls this `instructions.md` in some versions; use `AGENTS.md` for compatibility)
- `~/.codex/config.toml` — managed MCP server configs, merged with the user's existing Codex settings
- `~/.agents/skills/` — Codex reads the cross-tool `.agents/skills/`
  standard path natively (in addition to `~/.codex/skills/`). Keystone
  populates `~/.agents/skills/` via a home-manager directory symlink to
  `<consumer-flake>/agents/skills/`. See
  [docs/research/agent-skills.md](../docs/research/agent-skills.md) for
  the full standard.

**Important nuance**: Codex 0.114.0 had a documented bug where it failed
to discover skills when individual `SKILL.md` or `agents/openai.yaml`
*files* were symlinks. The current layout sidesteps this entirely —
`~/.agents/skills/` is a single directory symlink, and every file under
the resolved consumer-flake target is a regular file in the user's git
checkout. The refresh path is `ks sync-agent-assets` (manual), which
writes regenerated skill content into the consumer flake — never
directly into `~/.agents/skills/` or `~/.codex/skills/`.

### OpenCode

- **Docs**: https://opencode.ai/docs/rules/
- **File name**: `AGENTS.md` (primary)
- **User-level**: `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` — global instructions
- **Project-level**: `AGENTS.md` in project root (traverses upward)
- **Legacy compatibility**: Also reads `CLAUDE.md` (project) and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global) as fallbacks
- **Disable legacy**: `OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE=1` env var disables Claude Code file discovery
- **Additional instructions**: `opencode.json` → `instructions` field supports file paths, globs, and remote URLs
- **MCP config**: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`

**Keystone generates**:

- `~/.keystone/AGENTS.md` — canonical Keystone instruction file for the user profile
- `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` — system-wide conventions
- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — MCP server configs

**Note**: OpenCode's Claude Code compatibility means it reads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` by default.
Keystone SHOULD NOT configure OpenCode separately for now — it picks up Claude Code's
CLAUDE.md automatically. Disable compatibility later with `OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE=1`
when OpenCode-specific configuration is needed.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

- **Docs**: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli-agents/overview
- **Instruction files**:
  - Repository-wide: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - Path-specific: `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md`
  - Agent files: `AGENTS.md` in project root
- **User-level agents**: `~/.copilot/agents/` — custom agent profile `.md` files
- **Project-level agents**: `.github/agents/` — repo-specific agent profiles
- **Org-level agents**: `/agents` in `.github-private` repo
- **MCP config**: `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (managed via `/mcp add`)
- **Built-in agents**: Explore, Task, General-purpose, Code-review
- **Invocation**: `/agent`, inline prompt, or `copilot --agent=<name> --prompt ...`
- **Priority**: System > Repository > Organization agents

**Keystone generates**:

- Not currently provisioned by keystone (Copilot is a GitHub-hosted service, not a local CLI tool packaged by keystone)
- Project-level `AGENTS.md` at repo root is read by Copilot automatically

## Consumer Flake Agent Assets

Keystone-generated CLI coding agent assets (per-tool skills and subagents) are
materialized into the consumer flake at `<consumer-flake>/agents/<tool>/`, and
each tool's home-dir subdirectory is a home-manager-managed symlink pointing
there. This makes every change to a keystone-shipped skill visible as a git
diff in the consumer flake, so users can review skill upgrades commit-by-commit
and roll back via standard git workflow.

### Source layout

Keystone adopts the [`.agents/skills/` open standard][agent-skills-doc] for
the consumer-flake source-of-truth. The canonical layout:

```
<consumer-flake>/agents/
  _shared/
    AGENTS.md                         host-rendered instruction file (regular file)
    skills.yaml                       optional user-authored skill overrides
  skills/                             canonical, spec-compliant skill tree
    <name>/                           lowercase-hyphen (`ks-engineer`, `deepwork`, …)
      SKILL.md                        frontmatter `name:` matches dir name
      <convention>.md                 colocated conventions and roles
  claude/
    agents/                           Claude subagents (reserved; currently empty)
```

Per-tool dirs (`agents/claude/skills/`, `agents/gemini/skills/`,
`agents/codex/skills/`) do **not** exist in the consumer flake — every
agent reads skills from `~/.agents/skills/` natively per the open standard
(or, for Claude Code, from `~/.claude/skills/` which symlinks to the same
target).

[agent-skills-doc]: ../docs/research/agent-skills.md

### Home-dir layout

Home-manager activation creates these symlinks at switch time (content is
populated by `ks sync-agent-assets`):

| Home path | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.agents/skills/` | `<flake>/agents/skills/` | Read by Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Cursor, Rovo Dev, Kiro, OpenCode, Augment per [`.agents/skills/` spec][agent-skills-doc]. |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | `<flake>/agents/skills/` | Same target. Claude Code is the only holdout that doesn't read `~/.agents/skills/` natively; this shadow symlink gives it access without content duplication. |
| `~/.claude/agents/` | `<flake>/agents/claude/agents/` | Claude subagents (reserved). |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `<flake>/agents/_shared/AGENTS.md` | Single-hop symlink. |
| `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` | `<flake>/agents/_shared/AGENTS.md` | Same canonical file. |
| `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | `<flake>/agents/_shared/AGENTS.md` | Same canonical file. |

`~/.keystone/AGENTS.md`, `~/.keystone/repos/AGENTS.md`, and
`~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` remain immutable Nix-store-backed writes via
`home.file.text` in `modules/terminal/conventions.nix`. They are not tool
discovery paths; they are reference material keystone reads itself.

### Skill schema

`<consumer-flake>/agents/_shared/skills.yaml` is an **optional** user-authored
file with the same flat-map schema as `conventions/archetypes.yaml.skills` in
the keystone repo. When present, `ks sync-agent-assets` merges it on top of
the keystone defaults using jq's recursive merge operator (`*`): explicit
user fields override keystone fields per-field, missing user fields fall
back to keystone defaults, and keys only in the user file are emitted as
new skills. Overriding just `description` on a built-in skill preserves
the keystone-shipped `template:` and `colocated_conventions:`/`colocated_roles:`
automatically.

```yaml
skills:
  ks-engineer:                       # override an existing keystone key
    description: "Custom phrasing"
    colocated_conventions: []
  my-custom-skill:                   # add a new key
    description: "User-only skill"
    template: my-custom-skill-skill.template.md
```

The yaml key IS the canonical skill name. Per the
[`.agents/skills/` spec][agent-skills-doc] it MUST be lowercase with
hyphens — no dots, no underscores, no camelCase. Mismatch causes *silent*
load failure in Codex and most other spec-compliant tools.

The yaml key also matches the slash-command id the user types: keys
starting with `ks-` are gated by the manifest's `publishedCommands` and
only emit if the host has the matching command enabled. Other keys
(e.g. `deepwork`, `my-custom-skill`) are always emitted.

For each key:

- The on-disk skill directory under `agents/skills/` uses the key verbatim.
- The SKILL.md frontmatter `name:` field matches the directory.
- The body template resolves first to the `template:` field in yaml, then
  to `<key>-skill.template.md` by default.

If `_shared/skills.yaml` is absent, the renderer uses keystone defaults
verbatim.

### Migrating from per-tool fan-out (PR #539 / pre-merged shape)

PR #539 originally wrote per-tool dirs (`agents/claude/skills/`,
`agents/gemini/skills/`, `agents/codex/skills/`) and a codex-specific
rendering pipeline (hyphenated names, skill-invocation footer,
`agents/openai.yaml`). Both are gone — adoption of the
`.agents/skills/` standard makes them unnecessary because every
non-Claude tool reads the same shared path. The slash-command IDs also
rename from dotted to hyphenated (`/ks.engineer` → `/ks-engineer`,
`/ks.ea` → `/ks-ea`, etc.) so the skill name and slash command match.

On first sync after the migration, the script removes the legacy
`agents/{claude,gemini,codex}/` and `agents/_shared/skills/` trees from
the consumer flake. The deletions appear in `git status` so the user
can review them.

### Rules

11. The consumer flake at `<consumer-flake>/agents/skills/` MUST be the
    sole source-of-truth for keystone-generated and user-authored skill
    content for every CLI coding agent (Claude, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode,
    Copilot, Cursor, etc.). There is no parallel source in `$HOME` for
    skill content; tools read it via home-dir symlinks resolved by
    home-manager activation.
12. Home-manager activation MUST create the following directory symlinks:
    - `~/.agents/skills/` → `<consumer-flake>/agents/skills/` — the
      cross-tool [`.agents/skills/` spec][agent-skills-doc] path read by
      Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Cursor, Rovo Dev, Kiro, OpenCode,
      and Augment.
    - `~/.claude/skills/` → `<consumer-flake>/agents/skills/` — same
      target. Claude Code is the only agent that doesn't read
      `~/.agents/skills/` natively; this shadow symlink gives it access
      without content duplication.
    - `~/.claude/agents/` → `<consumer-flake>/agents/claude/agents/` —
      Claude subagents (Claude-specific feature, reserved).
    For the admin user, activation MUST `mkdir -p` the consumer-flake
    target before linking so the symlink is never dangling on first run.
    For OS agent users, the activation MUST NOT `mkdir -p` the target —
    see rule 18.
13. The consumer-flake path MUST be resolved at runtime from
    `/run/current-system/keystone-system-flake`. This is a **regular file**
    written by `modules/shared/system-flake.nix` containing the consumer
    flake path as text (single line plus trailing newline), not a symlink —
    implementations MUST read it with `read`/`cat` and strip the trailing
    newline, matching the Rust precedent in
    `packages/ks/src/repo.rs:read_system_flake_pointer_from`. Implementations
    MUST NOT use `[ -L ... ]`/`readlink` against this path (always false /
    always returns the wrong value). A `KEYSTONE_CONSUMER_FLAKE` env var
    MUST be honoured as an override for testing and ad-hoc invocations.
14. The `ks sync-agent-assets` command MUST be the only writer to the
    consumer-flake `agents/` directory. It MUST be run manually — home-manager
    activation MUST NOT auto-trigger it. This guarantees the user's git tree
    is never silently rewritten during `ks switch` / `ks update --dev`.
15. `ks sync-agent-assets` MUST unconditionally overwrite keystone-generated
    files. The user's override mechanism is git: review the diff, `git checkout`
    to restore a previous version, then commit. No in-file markers, no skip-if-exists.
16. User-authored skills and keystone-generated skills share a single
    namespace under `<consumer-flake>/agents/skills/`. Keystone-curated
    skills use the `ks-` name prefix (e.g. `ks-notes`, `ks-dev`);
    user-authored skills SHOULD avoid that prefix to reduce collision risk
    on regen. Skill names MUST be lowercase with hyphens per the
    [`.agents/skills/` spec][agent-skills-doc] — no dots, no underscores,
    no camelCase. Mismatch causes *silent* load failure in Codex and most
    spec-compliant tools.
17. Subagent emission is currently scoped to Claude (`~/.claude/agents/<name>.md`).
    Gemini has native subagent loading upstream and Codex has its own
    persona surface, but keystone does not currently wire either — the
    directories are reserved/not-yet-managed by keystone, not absent from
    the tools. When the keystone convention extends to those tools, no
    compatibility break is expected.
18. The symlink activation MUST run for both the admin user and OS agent
    users. Each agent's `~/.agents/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/` MUST
    symlink to the same consumer-flake `agents/skills/` path the admin
    uses. This L1→L2 inheritance mechanism lets
    `keystone.os.agents.<name>` principals run the same skills the admin
    authored, without per-agent duplication, and is the foundation for
    OS-agent auto-loops that don't require DeepWork. For OS agent users,
    the activation MUST NOT attempt to `mkdir -p` the consumer-flake
    target — the admin's prior activation created it, and the agent lacks
    write permission inside the admin's home.
19. Per-tool instruction files MUST be **single-hop** symlinks into the
    canonical `_shared/AGENTS.md`:
    - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`   → `<consumer-flake>/agents/_shared/AGENTS.md`
    - `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`   → `<consumer-flake>/agents/_shared/AGENTS.md`
    - `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`    → `<consumer-flake>/agents/_shared/AGENTS.md`
    The canonical `_shared/AGENTS.md` is the only regular file in the
    chain — every tool reads the same bytes.
    `modules/terminal/conventions.nix` MUST NOT write the per-tool
    instruction files via `home.file.<path>.text` — the symlink activation
    owns them. The Keystone-canonical files `~/.keystone/AGENTS.md` and
    `~/.keystone/repos/AGENTS.md`, and the OpenCode instruction file
    `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, remain managed via `home.file.text`
    (no tool reads them through a path that needs the symlink contract).
20. The symlink activation MUST handle file-level migrations from prior
    layouts. When the previous generation wrote `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
    as an immutable Nix-store symlink or pointed `~/.<tool>/skills` at
    a per-tool consumer-flake dir, home-manager removes that link during
    the switch; the activation then either creates the new symlink (if
    the consumer-flake target exists) or skips with a warning telling
    the user to run `ks sync-agent-assets`.

### First-time setup and migration

After this convention lands, `<consumer-flake>/agents/` holds two committed
trees: `agents/_shared/` (instruction file + optional user skill overrides)
and `agents/skills/` (canonical per-skill content). There are **no
per-tool dirs in the consumer flake** — every agent reads from a home-dir
symlink resolved at activation time. First-time setup on a fresh host:

```
ks sync-agent-assets       # writes _shared/ and skills/
cd <consumer-flake>
git status                 # _shared/ and skills/ should show as untracked
git add agents/_shared agents/skills
git commit -m "feat: add keystone agent assets"
ks switch                  # activation creates home-dir symlinks
```

Migrating from the PR #539 or pre-spec PR #542 shape:

```
# Old per-tool dirs and the temporary _shared/skills/ location are removed
# by the next `ks sync-agent-assets` run (which also writes the new shape).
# Pre-existing .gitignore entries for the old per-tool dirs are no longer
# needed; remove them in the same commit:
sed -i \
  -e '\|^/agents/claude/$|d' \
  -e '\|^/agents/gemini/$|d' \
  -e '\|^/agents/codex/$|d' \
  .gitignore
ks sync-agent-assets
git add agents/_shared agents/skills .gitignore
git commit -m "refactor(agents): adopt .agents/skills/ spec layout"
ks switch                  # activation reshapes the home-dir symlinks
```

A pre-existing non-empty real directory at one of the symlink sites
(`~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/agents`) will block the
activation with a clear error message. Remove or move the directory aside
before re-running activation.

## Keystone Module Responsibilities

### `modules/terminal/conventions.nix`

1. MUST generate the system-wide conventions content from `keystone-conventions` derivation
2. MUST write the canonical user-level instruction file to `~/.keystone/AGENTS.md`
3. MUST derive the tool-native user-level files from the same generated content
4. MUST symlink `~/.config/keystone/conventions/` to the conventions store path for on-demand reading

### `modules/terminal/agents/extensions.nix`

1. MUST generate only the curated Keystone command surface by default: `/ks`, optional `/ks-dev`, and `/deepwork`
2. MUST gate `/ks-dev` on `keystone.development = true`
3. MUST derive tool-facing descriptions and labels from the generated command definitions
4. MUST preserve YAML frontmatter for tools that natively consume Markdown metadata, including Claude Code commands and Codex skills
5. MUST render Gemini commands as native TOML rather than Markdown-based skill files
6. MUST keep command filenames and Codex skill ids stable unless a breaking rename is explicitly intended
7. `ks-notes` SHOULD act as the durable-memory skill for decision capture, report capture, and zk-linked shared-surface refs
8. Keystone workflow skills SHOULD remind agents to use `ks-notes` when work produces durable findings or decisions
9. Skill directory names and SKILL.md frontmatter `name:` fields MUST be lowercase with hyphens per the [`.agents/skills/` spec][agent-skills-doc] (e.g., `ks-system`, `ks-dev`, `configure-reviews`). The same name is used by every tool — no per-tool transform.
10. Generated instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`) MUST NOT duplicate the list of available skills. CLI coding agents inject the skill catalog into the system prompt automatically; repeating it in instruction files wastes context tokens.

### `modules/terminal/agents/mcp-configs.nix`

1. MUST generate MCP server configs at each tool's expected path
2. MUST NOT embed secrets (API keys, tokens) — these are world-readable in the Nix store
3. Currently generates: `~/.claude.json`, `~/.gemini/settings.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
4. Codex config management MUST preserve unrelated user settings and replace only the managed `mcp_servers` subtree

### `modules/os/agents/scripts/agentctl.sh`

1. MUST assemble the 4-layer system prompt (system conventions → notes identity → project AGENTS.md → roles)
2. MUST pass assembled prompt via each tool's native injection mechanism:
   - Claude: `--append-system-prompt`
   - Gemini: `--prompt-interactive`
   - Codex: `--instructions`
   - OpenCode: reads `AGENTS.md` natively from working directory
3. For sandboxed (Podman) agents, SHOULD generate overlay instruction files at the tool-native paths inside the container

### `packages/podman-agent/podman-agent.sh`

1. MUST mount host tool config directories into the container (`~/.claude`, `~/.gemini`, `~/.codex`, `~/.opencode`)
2. MUST mount `~/.config/keystone/` for conventions access
3. SHOULD accept overlay instruction files that combine all context layers

## Sandbox Nuances

When an agent runs inside a Podman container via `podman-agent`:

- The host's `~/.claude.json`, `~/.gemini/settings.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, etc. are mounted read-only
- MCP server commands in configs reference absolute Nix store paths — these resolve correctly only if the store closure is available in the container's persistent Nix volume
- Tool-native instruction files (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, etc.) ARE mounted since the host tool dirs are already mounted
- The `SP_FLAGS` prompt injection from agentctl works regardless of sandbox — it passes additional context as CLI args

### Convention Directory Access

`agentctl` / `podman-agent` MUST mount only `~/.config/keystone/conventions/` (read-only) into the container — NOT the full nixos-config repo or keystone submodule. This prevents agents from needlessly exploring infrastructure code that is outside their task scope. When a user needs to work with nixos-config or keystone modules directly, they MUST use `ks agent` or `ks doctor` instead, which have full repo context.

## Rules for Adding New Tools

1. Add the tool's package to `modules/terminal/agents/ai.nix`
2. Add MCP config generation to `modules/terminal/agents/mcp-configs.nix`
3. Add instruction file generation to `modules/terminal/conventions.nix` at the tool's expected user-level path
4. Add slash-command or skill generation to `modules/terminal/agents/extensions.nix`, depending on the tool's native workflow surface
5. Add the tool's config directory mount to `packages/podman-agent/podman-agent.sh`
6. Add the tool's prompt injection mechanism to `modules/os/agents/scripts/agentctl.sh`
7. Add a pre-resolved store path env var to `modules/terminal/sandbox.nix`
8. Update this convention document
