# REQ-002: Keystone Desktop

Functional requirements for the core Keystone Desktop environment: menu system,
keybindings, status bar, screen locking, night light, monitor management, and
theming infrastructure.

Key words: RFC 2119 (MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
MAY, REQUIRED, OPTIONAL).

## Functional Requirements

### Menu System (dt-menu-001)

The system MUST provide a unified, hierarchical menu accessible via a global keyboard shortcut (`Mod + Escape`) and the power button.

- **dt-menu-001.1**: The menu MUST allow navigation to sub-menus: Apps, Contexts, Agents, Learn, Capture, Toggle, Style, Setup, Install, Remove, Update, System.
- **dt-menu-001.2**: The "System" sub-menu MUST provide options for: Lock, Suspend, Restart, and Shutdown.
- **dt-menu-001.3**: The "Style" sub-menu MUST allow switching themes.
- **dt-menu-001.4**: The "Toggle" sub-menu MUST allow toggling system features like Nightlight, Idle Inhibition, and configuring Nightlight schedule and intensity.
- **dt-menu-001.5**: The "Capture" sub-menu MUST provide options for starting/stopping screen recordings and taking various types of screenshots.
- **dt-menu-001.6**: The "Learn" sub-menu MUST provide access to keybindings help and documentation.
- **dt-menu-001.7**: The menu MUST support direct navigation to specific sub-menus via command-line arguments.
- **dt-menu-001.8**: The "Setup" sub-menu MUST provide a "Monitors" section for dynamic display configuration (see dt-monitor-001).
- **dt-menu-001.9**: The menu MUST provide access to project and desktop context selection behavior defined in `dt-context-001`.
- **dt-menu-001.10**: Walker or Elephant MUST remain presentation-layer launchers only. Any long-lived terminal, editor, browser, or GUI process started from the menu MUST be detached from the menu process tree before the target command begins running.
- **dt-menu-001.11**: When an `agenix-secrets` managed repo is present, the Walker-backed Keystone menu MUST expose a secrets-management entry point for it.

### Desktop contexts (dt-context-001)

The system MUST provide project-aware desktop context selectors that integrate `pz`, Hyprland, and existing desktop session windows.

Detailed project desktop menu requirements are defined in `REQ-026`.

- **dt-context-001.1**: Desktop context selectors MUST list registered projects from the `pz` project registry.
- **dt-context-001.2**: When a selected project or session already has an active desktop window, the desktop MUST switch to the Hyprland workspace containing that window instead of opening a new terminal window.
- **dt-context-001.3**: The desktop MUST determine the target workspace from the live Hyprland client list, rather than assuming the session uses a named workspace.
- **dt-context-001.4**: If an active zellij session exists for the selected project or session but no matching desktop window exists, the desktop MUST open a new terminal attached to that existing session.
- **dt-context-001.5**: Choosing a project from the project list MUST open a project details or actions view before any switch or attach action occurs.
- **dt-context-001.6**: The project details or actions view MUST always include an explicit "New session" selection for each project, even when that project already has active sessions.
- **dt-context-001.7**: Choosing "New session" MUST prompt for a session slug before launch.
- **dt-context-001.8**: The session slug prompt MAY allow an empty value to create or attach to the project's main session.
- **dt-context-001.9**: The desktop MUST support both current `pz` session names and legacy `obs-<project>` session names when determining whether a session is active.
- **dt-context-001.10**: When multiple desktop windows correspond to the same active session, the desktop MUST prefer the focused matching window. If no matching window is focused, the desktop MUST choose a deterministic matching window.
- **dt-context-001.11**: The same active-session behavior MUST apply in both the dedicated context switcher and the menu-based project selector.
- **dt-context-001.12**: The project details or actions view MUST be reachable by keyboard. When the launcher supports directional key hooks, Right Arrow SHOULD open that view. When it does not, Enter or another primary selection action MAY open that view instead.
- **dt-context-001.13 (Delegation):** Desktop components MUST NOT implement domain logic for project discovery, session management, or metadata retrieval. They MUST delegate all such operations to the `pz` CLI or other terminal-first tools.
- **dt-context-001.14 (Experience Parity):** The desktop project menus SHOULD provide a visual experience that mirrors the information hierarchy and action set of the `pz` CLI, ensuring a seamless transition for users moving between terminal and desktop contexts.
- **dt-context-001.15 (Performance):** Desktop menus MUST utilize bulk data retrieval patterns (e.g., a single CLI call returning all required menu state) to ensure menu responsiveness and avoid N+1 performance bottlenecks.
- **dt-context-001.16 (Launcher Independence):** Opening or attaching a project session from the desktop menu MUST NOT tie the spawned terminal window or editor lifecycle to Walker or Elephant service lifetime. Restarting the launcher services MUST NOT close or interrupt the started session.
- **dt-context-001.17 (Host awareness):** Desktop project menus MUST show the declared host inventory and MUST allow users to change the effective target host before launch.
- **dt-context-001.18 (Remote transport):** When the effective target host is remote, the desktop MUST launch the project through a local terminal session that delegates to terminal-first remote project tooling.

### Project details page (dt-context-002)

The system SHOULD provide a project-specific details page reachable from the project menu.

- **dt-context-002.1**: The project details page MUST display project information sourced from the notes project hub when available.
- **dt-context-002.2**: The project details page SHOULD display active milestones for the project's GitHub repository.
- **dt-context-002.2a**: When GitHub milestone data is unavailable, the page MAY fall back to milestone data stored in the notes project hub.
- **dt-context-002.3**: For each active milestone shown, the page SHOULD display associated open issues and due dates when available.
- **dt-context-002.4**: If notes, milestone, or issue data is unavailable, the page MUST degrade gracefully without preventing project and session actions.

### Monitor Management (dt-monitor-001)

The system MUST provide an interactive menu for configuring displays at runtime, optimized for presentation scenarios.

- **dt-monitor-001.1**: The monitor menu MUST list all currently connected displays.
- **dt-monitor-001.2**: The monitor menu MUST allow selecting any connected display before presenting monitor-specific actions.
- **dt-monitor-001.3**: The menu MUST support live session changes for scale, resolution, orientation, enable or disable, mirroring, and relative placement.
- **dt-monitor-001.4**: Resolution choices MUST come from the selected monitor's live advertised modes rather than a fixed global preset list.
- **dt-monitor-001.5**: The menu MUST distinguish between temporary live session changes and saved host-default changes.
- **dt-monitor-001.6**: Saving monitor defaults from the menu MUST update the current host's personal keystone config repository so later sessions derive monitor state from declarative configuration.
- **dt-monitor-001.7**: The menu SHOULD expose the persisted `keystone.desktop.monitors` state in a form that remains reviewable and committable in the user's personal config repository.
- **dt-monitor-001.8**: The system MUST support an `autoMirror` configuration option that, when enabled, automatically mirrors the primary display to any newly connected external display.

### Audio management (dt-audio-001)

The system MUST provide an interactive menu for inspecting and changing the
default audio input and output devices.

- **dt-audio-001.1**: The setup menu MUST provide an audio section reachable from the main Keystone menu.
- **dt-audio-001.2**: The audio menu MUST list available output devices and clearly mark the current default output.
- **dt-audio-001.3**: The audio menu MUST list available input devices and clearly mark the current default input.
- **dt-audio-001.4**: Selecting an audio device from the menu MUST update the live default device immediately and show a confirmation notification.
- **dt-audio-001.5**: Default audio device changes made from the menu MUST be persisted into the current host's personal keystone config repository so the desktop session derives those defaults from declarative configuration on later starts.
- **dt-audio-001.6**: The menu backend for audio defaults SHOULD remain terminal-first so the same commands can be used directly in a shell or wrapped by Elephant or Walker.

### Agenix secrets management (dt-secrets-001)

The system MUST provide a desktop menu flow for inspecting and maintaining the
managed `agenix-secrets` repo from Walker.

- **dt-secrets-001.1**: The Walker menu MUST list available `agenix` secret entries from the managed `agenix-secrets` checkout in a form that remains searchable by secret name.
- **dt-secrets-001.2**: Secret listing and metadata lookup MUST remain terminal-first. The desktop menu MUST delegate discovery, inspection, key updates, and rekey operations to CLI tooling rather than reimplementing agenix logic in the launcher layer.
- **dt-secrets-001.3**: Selecting a secret entry MUST open a secret actions view before any sensitive operation is attempted.
- **dt-secrets-001.4**: The secret actions view MUST expose a `View value` action only when the current user can decrypt the secret. If the user does not have access, the menu MUST clearly show that the value cannot be viewed and MUST NOT attempt decryption.
- **dt-secrets-001.5**: When `View value` succeeds, the menu MUST display the decrypted value in a deliberate inspection flow that does not require dropping into a separate manual shell session.
- **dt-secrets-001.6**: The secret actions view MUST provide a way to update the secret's recipient keys.
- **dt-secrets-001.7**: Updating recipient keys from the menu MUST trigger rekeying automatically so the encrypted secret set remains consistent after the change.
- **dt-secrets-001.8**: Automatic rekeying initiated from the menu SHOULD prefer the existing hardware-key workflow when supported by the current machine and user configuration, and SHOULD fall back to non-hardware-key agenix rekeying when hardware-backed rekey is not available.
- **dt-secrets-001.9**: Secret value inspection, key updates, and rekey actions MUST fail closed with a clear error message when the required identity, hardware key, repo checkout, or decrypt permission is unavailable.
- **dt-secrets-001.10**: Secret-management actions that modify the `agenix-secrets` repo MUST operate on the managed checkout under `~/.keystone/repos/{owner}/{repo}/` so the resulting changes remain reviewable and committable through the normal repo workflow.
- **dt-secrets-001.11**: The secret-management surface MUST expose at least four first-class secret categories: os-level secrets, service secrets, user-home secrets, and custom secrets.
- **dt-secrets-001.12**: The secret-management surface MUST make the intended scope of a secret visible before edit actions run, including whether the secret is os-level, service-owned, user-home-scoped, or custom.
- **dt-secrets-001.13**: For user-home secrets, the secret-management surface MUST help users derive or validate the full host recipient set from the hosts where that Home Manager user is installed, rather than treating the current host as the only recipient by default.
- **dt-secrets-001.14**: The desktop flow SHOULD make the shared naming convention for user-home secrets discoverable, so users can create reusable secrets such as per-user GitHub, Forgejo, or API tokens without inventing ad hoc names.
- **dt-secrets-001.15**: Keystone MAY provide the same secret-management contract through a terminal-first `ks secrets` interface, but Walker and any terminal entrypoint MUST follow the same secret categories, naming conventions, and recipient-derivation rules.

### Keybindings Help (dt-help-001)

The system MUST provide a searchable display of current keyboard shortcuts, accessible via `Mod + K`.

- **dt-help-001.1**: The display MUST dynamically fetch active keybindings from the window manager.
- **dt-help-001.2**: The display MUST map keycodes to human-readable symbols (e.g., converting keycode 272 to "Left Mouse Button").
- **dt-help-001.3**: The display MUST allow filtering/searching of keybindings by description or key combination.
- **dt-help-001.4**: The entries MUST be prioritized/sorted by category (e.g., Window Management, Launchers).

### Status Bar (dt-bar-001)

The system MUST provide a status bar (Waybar) at the top of the screen.

- **dt-bar-001.1**: The bar MUST display: Keystone launcher icon, Workspaces, Clock, Screen recording status, Tray (expandable), Bluetooth, Network, Audio, CPU usage, and Battery.
- **dt-bar-001.2**: The workspace indicator MUST show active workspaces and allow navigation by clicking.
- **dt-bar-001.3**: The screen recording indicator MUST appear only when recording is active and MUST allow stopping the recording.
- **dt-bar-001.4**: The tray MUST be collapsible/expandable to save space.
- **dt-bar-001.5**: The battery module MUST change icons based on charge level and charging status.

### Screen Locking (dt-lock-001)

The system MUST provide a secure screen locking mechanism (Hyprlock).

- **dt-lock-001.1**: The lock screen MUST support fingerprint authentication.
- **dt-lock-001.2**: The lock screen MUST display the current time and a customized background.
- **dt-lock-001.3**: The lock screen MUST provide visual feedback for authentication failures.
- **dt-lock-001.4**: The look and feel MUST align with the active system theme.

### Lock Inhibition (dt-inhibit-001)

The system MUST provide a mechanism to prevent automatic screen locking/suspension for specific applications or activities.

- **dt-inhibit-001.1**: The system MUST allow for temporary manual inhibition of screen locking/suspension.
- **dt-inhibit-001.2**: The system MUST ignore D-Bus inhibition requests (e.g., from web browsers playing media) by default to ensure the screen locks when the user is idle.

### Night Light (dt-night-001)

The system MUST provide a blue light filter (Hyprsunset) to reduce eye strain.

- **dt-night-001.1**: The filter MUST be toggleable via the Menu System or a keyboard shortcut.
- **dt-night-001.2**: The filter MUST support user-configurable schedule (start/end times) and intensity (color temperature).
- **dt-night-001.3**: The schedule and intensity settings MUST be configurable via the Menu System.

### Theming System (dt-theme-001)

The system MUST provide a centralized theming infrastructure to switch the visual appearance of all desktop components consistently.

- **dt-theme-001.1**: The system MUST support switching between multiple themes (e.g., Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, Nord).
- **dt-theme-001.2**: Switching a theme MUST update: window manager colors/borders, status bar, terminal emulator, text editor, application launcher, notification daemon, wallpaper, and GTK/GNOME interface settings.
- **dt-theme-001.3**: The system MUST persist the selected theme across reboots.
- **dt-theme-001.4**: The system MUST allow custom themes defined locally, in addition to upstream themes.

### Screen Recording (dt-record-001)

The system MUST allow starting and stopping screen recordings, capturing a selected region or the entire screen, with optional audio capture.

- **dt-record-001.1**: The screen recording MUST be toggleable via the "Capture" menu or a dedicated shortcut.

- **dt-record-001.6**: The recording MUST use GPU-accelerated encoding at 60 FPS with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec.
- **dt-record-001.7**: Recording MUST provide visual notifications for start, stop, and error conditions with file path confirmation on completion.

### Screenshots (dt-shot-001)

The system MUST allow capturing screenshots of a selected region, window, or entire screen.

- **dt-shot-001.1**: Taking a screenshot MUST open it in an editor for review and annotation.
- **dt-shot-001.2**: Within the editor, a specific command (e.g., `Mod+C`) MUST save the screenshot to the Pictures directory and close the editor.
