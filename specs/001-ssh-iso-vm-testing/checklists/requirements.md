# Specification Quality Checklist: SSH-Enabled ISO with VM Testing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Updated**: 2025-10-17 (Revised based on feat/quickemu-server implementation)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Current implementation status clearly documented

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] Existing implementation acknowledged (feat/quickemu-server branch)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Clear separation between completed and remaining work

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification is written in user-focused language without technical implementation details. All sections describe WHAT and WHY without HOW.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Requirements clearly separated between implemented and remaining:
- Already implemented: FR-001 through FR-005, FR-009, FR-010 (ISO building with SSH)
- Remaining: FR-006 through FR-008, FR-011 through FR-017 (VM lifecycle and SSH helpers)
- Each FR can be verified through testing
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, completion rate)
- Edge cases cover key failure scenarios

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Feature is well-defined and ready for planning:
- User stories revised to focus on remaining work (P1: Automated workflow, P2: VM lifecycle, P3: SSH helper)
- Functional requirements clearly marked as implemented or remaining
- Success criteria are observable outcomes (workflow time, connection success, error messages)
- Builds upon existing feat/quickemu-server branch work

## Implementation Context

### Already Available (feat/quickemu-server)
- `bin/build-iso` script with full SSH key support
- `modules/iso-installer.nix` with SSH configuration
- `vms/server.conf` quickemu configuration
- `make vm-server` Makefile target
- SSH port forwarding on 22220

### To Be Implemented
- VM lifecycle management commands
- SSH connection display/helper
- Integration workflow automation
- Error handling and validation

## Notes

- Specification updated to reflect existing implementation in feat/quickemu-server branch
- Focus shifted from building SSH-enabled ISOs (completed) to VM testing workflow (remaining)
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation tasks for remaining work
- Will rebase onto feat/quickemu-server branch before implementation
