# Specification Quality Checklist: Secure Boot Setup Mode for VM Testing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- Spec focuses on developer needs (verifying Secure Boot setup mode)
- Written in terms of user goals and outcomes, not technical implementation
- Uses `bootctl status` as a verification method (what to check) not how it's implemented
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "within 2 minutes", "100% of new VMs")
- All success criteria avoid implementation details (OVMF, libvirt mentioned only in context, not as success metrics)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format and are specific
- Edge cases cover key failure scenarios (firmware unavailable, corruption, etc.)
- Scope is clear: setup mode verification only, not key enrollment
- Dependencies identified (OVMF firmware, NVRAM state)

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- FR-005 directly maps to acceptance scenario (bootctl status shows "Secure Boot: setup")
- User Story 1 covers the primary flow with clear test criteria
- Success criteria SC-001 and SC-002 align with the core feature goal
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear, focused scope (setup mode verification only)
- Measurable success criteria aligned with user needs
- Well-defined edge cases
- Technology references used appropriately (as tools, not requirements)
