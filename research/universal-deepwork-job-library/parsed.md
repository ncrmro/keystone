# Universal DeepWork Job Library

## Key Findings

- **118+ standardized jobs** cataloged across 17 domains (business, engineering, aerospace, medicine, security, education, agriculture, art, defense, architecture, and more), each decomposed into atomic reusable steps with workflow variants
- **7 universal reusable steps** identified that appear across 5+ jobs: `gather_sources` (20+), `write_report` (40+), `stakeholder_review` (30+), `synthesize` (15+), `compliance_check` (12+), `deep_research` (10+), and `check_citations` (5+)
- **Three meta-workflow patterns** emerge across all domains: "Research -> Analyze -> Report" (research-intensive), "Audit -> Gap -> Remediate" (compliance-oriented), and "Design -> Build -> Review -> Ship" (engineering-oriented)
- **Multi-agent parallelization** is consistently applicable during collection/development phases — independent tasks feeding the same objective are bracketed for concurrent execution across every domain
- **Quality gates as circuit breakers** — centralized approval checkpoints appear at critical junctures in every domain (CDR in aerospace, spec review in software, FDA approval in medicine), proving that while execution can be parallelized, approval remains a distinct centralized function

## Catalog

The full catalog of 118 jobs is in [jobs.yaml](jobs.yaml) — queryable with `yq`:

```bash
# List all jobs in a domain
yq '.jobs[] | select(.domain == "software_engineering") | .name' jobs.yaml

# Find jobs using a reusable step
yq '.jobs[] | select(.reusable_steps[] == "gather_sources") | .name' jobs.yaml

# Count jobs per domain
yq '[.jobs[] | .domain] | group_by(.) | map({(.[0]): length}) | add' jobs.yaml

# List all workflow names for a job
yq '.jobs[] | select(.name == "incident_response") | .workflows | keys' jobs.yaml

# Find jobs with concurrent steps
yq '.jobs[] | select(.workflows[].steps[] | type == "!!seq") | .name' jobs.yaml
```

### Example Job

## Research Context

### Original Research Brief

The original research brief requested a comprehensive catalog of standardized DeepWork jobs and workflows enabling multiple agents to make coordinated progress across business, engineering, scientific, and operational missions. Each job was to be decomposed into reusable steps shareable across workflows.

The brief specified the DeepWork architecture primitives:
- **Job**: A named capability containing steps and workflows
- **Step**: An atomic unit of work with defined inputs, outputs, and instructions
- **Workflow**: A named execution path through a subset of a job's steps
- **Quality Gate**: Review criteria applied after step completion
- **Concurrent Steps**: Steps in brackets execute in parallel

The research covered 17+ domains: Business & Strategy, Competitive Intelligence, Finance, Software Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace, Electrical Engineering, Art & Creative, Marketing, Medicine & Healthcare, Physical Security, Compliance & Legal, Geopolitical Affairs, Deep Space Missions, Operations & Project Management, Human Resources, Education & Training, plus cross-domain patterns including Robotics, Defense/Skunkworks, Agriculture/Botany/Horticulture, and Architecture/Urban Design.
