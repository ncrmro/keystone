# GitHub PAT via agenix

Companion to [`onboarding.md`](onboarding.md) Step 8. Optional but recommended.

## Why

GitHub limits anonymous API requests to **60 per hour per source IP**.
Authenticated requests get 5000/hr.

The 60/hr ceiling is easy to hit on a single host:

- Every `nix flake update keystone` triggers metadata + tarball fetches.
- `gh` CLI commands count against the same limit when unauthenticated.
- `ks update` queries GitHub for release info on each invocation.

Symptoms when you hit it:

```
error: unable to download '...': HTTP error 403
  message: API rate limit exceeded for 1.2.3.4. ...
```

Wiring a Personal Access Token (PAT) per host raises your ceiling to 5000/hr
*per token*. The token lives encrypted in your `keystone-config` repo via
agenix, decrypted at runtime by the host's age key.

## Step A — Generate a fine-grained PAT

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens>.
2. **Generate new token** → Fine-grained tokens.
3. **Resource owner**: yourself.
4. **Repository access**: "Only select repositories" → pick the repos you want
   to access (typically just `<you>/keystone-config` and any private repos
   you'll touch). "Public Repositories (read-only)" is *not* enough —
   read-only PATs aren't issued auth credit on the API, defeating the point.
5. **Repository permissions**:
   - `Contents`: **Read** (Read and write if `ks update` will push lock changes back)
   - `Pull requests`: **Read and write** (only if you'll open PRs from this host)
   - `Issues`: **Read** (only if you'll list/file issues from this host)
   - `Metadata`: Read (auto)
6. **Expiration**: max 366 days. Set a calendar reminder to rotate before it
   expires — the host will silently fall back to anonymous and you'll see
   403s again.
7. Click **Generate token**, copy the value (starts with `github_pat_`).

## Step B — Encrypt with agenix

The template ships a `secrets/` directory and a `secrets.nix` recipients file
(both commented out by default). Uncomment the relevant lines.

1. Edit `secrets.nix`. Uncomment the `<username>-github-token` entry. Set
   `publicKeys` to include:
   - Your driver's age public key (so you can edit the secret later).
   - The target host's age public key (so the target can decrypt the secret
     at runtime).

   Your driver's age key is typically `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` converted via
   `ssh-to-age`. The target's host key is `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`
   on the target, also converted with `ssh-to-age`.

   ```bash
   nix shell nixpkgs#ssh-to-age --command ssh-to-age -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

2. Encrypt the PAT. From the repo root:

   ```bash
   nix shell nixpkgs#agenix --command agenix -e secrets/<username>-github-token.age
   ```

   An editor opens. Paste the PAT value (no trailing newline). Save and exit.

3. Commit `secrets.nix` and `secrets/<username>-github-token.age`. The `.age`
   file is encrypted ciphertext — safe to commit.

## Step C — Wire the secret into your flake

Keystone's operating-system module already imports `agenix.nixosModules.default`,
so you don't need to add an `agenix` input to your `flake.nix`. Just uncomment
the `age.secrets` block and the shell-init hook in your host's
`configuration.nix`:

```nix
programs.zsh.initExtra = ''
  if [ -f /run/agenix/<username>-github-token ]; then
    export GITHUB_TOKEN="$(tr -d '\n' < /run/agenix/<username>-github-token)"
  fi
'';
```

(Use `programs.bash.initExtra` if the user's shell is bash.)

## Step D — Rebuild

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<host>
```

After activation, the secret is materialized at `/run/agenix/<username>-github-token`
owned by the user, mode `0400`.

## Step E — Verify

Open a fresh shell on the target (so `programs.zsh.initExtra` runs):

```bash
# GITHUB_TOKEN should be set
echo "${GITHUB_TOKEN:0:8}…"   # prints first 8 chars; safe to share

# gh CLI picks it up automatically
gh api /user --jq .login

# Should print your GitHub username
```

Run a flake update to confirm Nix's fetcher is authenticated:

```bash
nix flake update keystone
```

The first fetches go to `api.github.com`. They should not 403.

## Future enhancement: Nix's `access-tokens`

`gh` and `ks` read `GITHUB_TOKEN` from env naturally, so the shell-init export
is enough for them. Nix's flake fetcher reads from
`nix.settings.access-tokens` — but setting that statically embeds the token in
the Nix store, which violates the keystone convention against
store-embedding secrets.

The clean fix is a per-boot activation script that writes
`/etc/nix/access-tokens.conf` from the runtime agenix file, plus
`nix.extraOptions = "!include /etc/nix/access-tokens.conf";`. This isn't
wired in the template yet — track in a future docs update. For now the shell
export covers ~all real cases (Nix's fetcher uses `gh auth` or the env var
when available, depending on flags).

## Rotating the PAT

When your PAT is near expiry:

1. Generate a new PAT in the GitHub UI (same scopes).
2. Re-encrypt: `agenix -e secrets/<username>-github-token.age`, paste new
   value, save.
3. Commit the updated `.age` file.
4. Rebuild on each consuming host: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<host>`.

The old PAT can be revoked in the GitHub UI immediately after the rebuild
lands.
