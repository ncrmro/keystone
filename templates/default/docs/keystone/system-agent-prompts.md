# System agent prompts

Any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, opencode, …) loads
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) automatically when you open this directory.
That file lists every doc in this repo and tells the agent which one to
consult before reasoning from scratch. Your prompt only needs to state what
you want — the agent already has the context.

The prompts below are copy-pasteable starting points. Tweak the
placeholders, paste into your agent, and iterate from there.

## Onboarding

**Bootstrap my first host:**

> Ask me clarifying questions about my setup (the hosts I want, where my
> SSH key lives, what OS I'm driving from), then walk me through the first
> three onboarding steps, including the exact edits to `flake.nix`.

**Add a new host to an existing fleet:**

> I want to add a new `<kind>` host called `<name>` to my fleet. Walk me
> through the `flake.nix` entry, the `hosts/<name>/` directory shape, and
> any `keystoneServices.*.host` wiring I should update. Stop and ask before
> editing anything that affects other hosts.

## Learning

**How is the flake wired:**

> Summarize how `mkSystemFlake` turns my inventory into flake outputs, and
> call out arguments I'm not using yet that might be relevant for my fleet.

**Explain a specific module:**

> I see `keystone.nixosModules.<name>` referenced in `flake.nix`. Read the
> source in the keystone repo and explain what it does, what other modules
> it pulls in, and what I should know before enabling it.

## Secrets

**Add an agenix-encrypted secret:**

> I want to add an agenix-encrypted `<name>` secret consumed by the
> `<host>` host. Walk me through encrypting it, declaring `age.secrets.*`,
> and reading it at runtime without leaking through the Nix store.

**Rotate a secret near expiry:**

> The `<name>` secret is approaching expiry. Walk me through generating
> a fresh credential, re-encrypting `secrets/<name>.age` with the same
> recipients, committing, deploying, and revoking the old credential.

## Operations

**Diagnose system health and security posture:**

> Run `ks doctor` and walk me through the output. Then audit my security
> posture — LUKS unlock method (password / recovery key / TPM / hardware
> key), Secure Boot enrollment, whether `ssh-agent` has my key loaded, and
> whether fingerprint hardware is present but not enrolled. Call out which
> of those `ks doctor` doesn't currently check so I know what's a real
> gap vs. an unanswered question.

**Plan a fleet-wide upgrade:**

> I'm about to run `ks update` across `<host1>,<host2>,...`. Read the
> recent commits on `github:ncrmro/keystone` since my current lock, flag
> anything risky (NixOS module renames, breaking option changes, new
> required arguments), and recommend whether to deploy all hosts at once
> or stage by kind.

## Build + install

**Build and verify the installer ISO:**

> Run `nix build .#iso` and confirm the result exists in `result/iso/`.
> Then walk me through writing it to a USB stick using the right `dd`
> incantation for my OS (ask if you don't know which OS I'm on).

**Walk me through a fresh install on the new host:**

> The installer USB is booted on the target. Walk me through `ks install`
> with the temporary credentials (`admin/keystone` login, LUKS password
> `keystone`), then guide me through Steps 6–8 of `onboarding.md`. When we
> reach Step 7, switch to `docs/keystone/hardware-enrollment.md` and walk me
> through `ks hardware report`, `ks hardware setup --dry-run`, and the real
> `ks hardware setup` run with exact commands and expected output.
