description: Progressive walkthrough from `nix flake new` to a fully-secured first host
---

# Keystone onboarding

This walkthrough takes a freshly scaffolded `keystone-config` and gets you to a
first running host. It is **progressive**: each step is independently readable,
makes one focused change, and ends with a "you should now see…" check. Stop
whenever it makes sense — you can carry on later from the same point without
re-reading earlier steps.

The walkthrough assumes you have *one* current machine (call it your **driver**;
likely your MacBook or current Linux box) and are bringing up *one* new
**target** host (likely a fresh laptop or server). Steps 1–4 happen on the
driver, step 5 happens during install, steps 6–8 happen on the target after
first boot.

## What you'll have at the end

- An installer ISO with your SSH key baked in, flashed to a USB stick.
- The target host installed, booting from its own disk, reachable over SSH.
- A per-host SSH key generated on the target — your driver's key was only the
  bootstrap.
- The temporary `keystone` LUKS password and TPM-less unlock replaced with a
  user-chosen password and TPM auto-unlock.
- (Optional) An agenix-encrypted GitHub PAT wired in so `ks update` and
  `nix flake update` don't trip the 60 req/hr anonymous rate limit.

## Anatomy of each step

Every numbered step below uses the same anatomy:

- **Goal** — what you'll have when the step is done.
- **Edit** — files to change, with the exact field.
- **Run** — commands.
- **Verify** — what success looks like.
- **If it fails** — one-line pointer.

---

## Step 0 — Decide your hosts

**Goal:** Pick the first host you want to bring up. This walkthrough scaffolds a
`laptop`. If you only need a server, use the `server-ocean` host instead — the
flow is the same, just substitute the name.

**Edit:** Nothing yet.

**Run:** Read the host list. Each subdirectory under `hosts/` is one host:

```bash
ls hosts/
# laptop  macbook  server-ocean
```

**Verify:** You can name the one host you'll bring up first.

**If it fails:** You're in the wrong directory. `cd` into the repo you just
made with `nix flake new`.

---

## Step 1 — Fill in owner identity

**Goal:** Replace the `Your Name` / `keystone@example.com` placeholders in
`flake.nix` with your real identity. This is the user that will be created on
every host.

**Edit:** `flake.nix`. Find the `admin` block (look for `TODO:` markers) and
set:

- `username` — your login name (lowercase, no spaces). This is the Linux user
  account created on the target.
- `fullName` — your display name.
- `email` — used for Git commits made on the host.
- `timeZone` — IANA tz name, e.g. `America/Chicago` or `Europe/Berlin`. See
  `timedatectl list-timezones` on a Linux box.

Leave `initialPassword = "changeme"` for now — Step 5 walks through replacing
it.

**Run:**

```bash
nix flake check
```

**Verify:** `nix flake check` exits 0 with no errors. If the placeholders are
still present, the check should still pass — the placeholders don't break
evaluation, they're just wrong values.

**If it fails:** `nix flake check` errors usually point at the file and line.
Most likely cause at this stage: missing quotes around a string value, or
removed a comma.

---

## Step 2 — Add your driver's SSH key

**Goal:** Bake your *current machine's* SSH public key into the installer ISO,
so that when the target host boots from the USB, you can SSH into the live
installer from your driver.

This step uses your driver's existing key. You'll generate a new per-host key
*on the target* later (Step 6).

**Edit:** Find your driver's public key:

```bash
# On macOS / Linux
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub        # preferred
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub            # fallback if no ed25519 key

# No key yet? Generate one:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email"
```

Paste the full pubkey line into `flake.nix` under `admin.sshKeys`:

```nix
admin = {
  username = "...";
  fullName = "...";
  email = "...";
  initialPassword = "changeme";
  sshKeys = [
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAA... your@driver"
  ];
};
```

**Run:**

```bash
grep -A2 sshKeys flake.nix
```

**Verify:** The grep output shows your key string.

**If it fails:** Common mistakes: forgetting the surrounding double quotes,
splitting the key across multiple lines, or pasting the *private* key by
accident. The public key starts with `ssh-` and is a single line.

---

## Step 3 — Build the installer ISO

**Goal:** Produce a bootable ISO at `result/iso/` with your SSH key embedded.

See [`build-and-burn.md`](build-and-burn.md) for cross-platform notes (building
an x86_64-linux ISO from an aarch64-darwin MacBook needs a remote builder or
relies on Hydra cache hits).

**Run:**

```bash
nix build .#iso
```

The ISO is a single artifact that bakes in installer targets for every Linux
host declared in `flake.nix` — you don't build a per-host ISO.

**Verify:**

```bash
ls -lh result/iso/
# -r--r--r-- 1 root root 1.4G ... keystone-server-installer-0.0.0.iso
```

A `.iso` file should be present and at least several hundred MB.

**If it fails:** If the build wants to compile something huge from source
(GHC, Chromium, etc.), your Nix instance is missing the keystone cache. Add
`ks-systems.cachix.org` to `nix.settings.substituters` on your driver, or
build on a host that already has it (e.g. another keystone machine).

---

## Step 4 — Burn the ISO to USB

**Goal:** Write `result/iso/*.iso` to a USB stick.

See [`build-and-burn.md`](build-and-burn.md) for the full commands. Summary:

- **Linux:** `lsblk` → identify the USB device → `sudo dd if=result/iso/*.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync && sync`
- **macOS:** `diskutil list` → `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN` → `sudo dd if=result/iso/*.iso of=/dev/rdiskN bs=4m status=progress && sync`

> **Warning:** `dd` destroys all data on the target device. Verify with
> `lsblk` / `diskutil list` *immediately before* running `dd` that the device
> path is the USB stick, not your driver's disk.

**Verify:** Plug the USB into the target host. Power on. Select the USB from
the UEFI boot menu. The Keystone installer banner appears on the screen.

**If it fails:** UEFI won't boot the USB → confirm Secure Boot is *off* in
firmware for now (you'll enroll keys in Step 7). Wrong key bytes → re-burn,
maybe the `dd` was interrupted.

---

## Step 5 — Install the target

**Goal:** Use `ks install` (or `nixos-anywhere`) to lay down the OS on the
target's local disk.

**Run:**

The installer auto-DHCPs and starts SSH. From the target's console, note its
IP (`ip addr show`). From your driver:

```bash
ssh root@<installer-ip>           # SSH key from Step 2 auths you
```

Once SSHed in, on the target:

```bash
ks install --host laptop
```

This runs the headless disko + nixos-install flow. The installer:

1. Partitions the target's disk per the disko config in `hosts/laptop/`.
2. Creates a LUKS volume with the **temporary password `keystone`**. You'll
   replace it in Step 7.
3. Installs the closure built for your `laptop` configuration.
4. Reboots into the installed system.

**Alternative:** If you prefer to drive from the driver rather than over SSH,
use `nixos-anywhere --flake .#laptop root@<installer-ip>`. Same result.

**Verify:** The target reboots and boots into the installed system. You can
SSH in as your owner user: `ssh <username>@<target-ip>`. The initial password
is `changeme` (from `flake.nix`).

**If it fails:** Install errors usually surface in the SSH session.
`nixos-install` failures are the most common — check disk free space and
that the disko config matches the target's actual block devices.

---

## Step 6 — First-boot housekeeping (per-host SSH key + password)

**Goal:** Replace the bootstrap-from-driver SSH credential with a per-host
identity, and replace the `changeme` user password.

**Edit:** Nothing in the repo yet — these changes happen *on the target*.

**Run:** On the target (SSH in as your owner user):

```bash
# Replace the changeme user password
passwd

# Generate a per-host SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<username>@<hostname>"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the new pubkey output. **On your driver**, edit your `keystone-config`
repo:

- Add the new pubkey to `admin.sshKeys` in `flake.nix`. Keep your driver's
  key in the list too — you may want to SSH from both.

Commit and push the repo change (assuming you've initialized a Git remote;
not required for v1).

**Verify:**

```bash
# On the driver
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <username>@<target-ip>
```

You're back in. The new per-host key on the target can also be used to SSH
*from* the target to other hosts.

**If it fails:** `passwd` complaining about complexity → use a longer
passphrase. SSH refusing the new key → you need to deploy the new `flake.nix`
to the target (`sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#laptop` after copying the
repo over, or wait until `ks update` is wired up).

---

## Step 7 — Enroll TPM unlock + replace the `keystone` LUKS password

**Goal:** Move from "anyone with the literal string `keystone` can unlock your
disk" to "the TPM unlocks the disk automatically when Secure Boot, kernel, and
initrd match expected measurements, and a user-chosen password is the fallback."

**Edit:** Nothing in the repo. The enrollment is a one-shot on the target.

**Run:** On the target, as your owner user:

```bash
sudo keystone-enroll-password
```

This script:

1. Prompts you for a new LUKS password (cannot be `keystone`).
2. Adds your new password to a LUKS keyslot.
3. Enrolls the TPM with the current PCR measurements so future boots
   auto-unlock without prompting (unless boot integrity changes).
4. **Removes the default `keystone` keyslot.**

For TPM-only enrollment (no password fallback — advanced; rescue media required
if the TPM ever fails) or recovery-key enrollment, see `keystone-enroll-tpm`
and `keystone-enroll-recovery`.

**Verify:**

```bash
# Reboot
sudo systemctl reboot
```

After reboot, the disk should unlock without prompting for a password. The
shell login prompts for your *user* password (set in Step 6), not the LUKS
password.

To prove the `keystone` slot is gone:

```bash
sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/disk/by-partlabel/disk-root-root | grep -A1 'Keyslot'
```

Should not show the slot that was tied to `keystone`. (Slot indices differ by
disko config — the key signal is that `cryptsetup open --test-passphrase` with
input `keystone` fails.)

**If it fails:** TPM enrollment can fail if the system was booted without
Secure Boot enabled or with mismatched PCRs. The script tells you which. If
you can't recover, the `keystone` slot is still active until the script
explicitly removes it (read the script's output carefully — it confirms before
deleting).

---

## Step 8 — (Optional) Add an agenix-encrypted GitHub PAT

**Goal:** Stop hitting GitHub's 60 req/hr anonymous rate limit (the source of
recurring `403 API rate limit exceeded` errors during `ks update` and
`nix flake update`).

See [`github-token.md`](github-token.md) for the full walkthrough. Summary:

1. Generate a fine-grained PAT at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens>
2. Encrypt it with agenix into `secrets/<username>-github-token.age`.
3. Uncomment the `age.secrets` block in `flake.nix` and the host configuration.
4. Rebuild and reboot.

Without this, you'll still install fine — it just makes subsequent updates
more reliable on flaky networks or shared IPs.

---

## What's next

- More hosts: copy `hosts/laptop/` to a new directory, adjust `configuration.nix`
  and `hardware.nix`, add the host name to `flake.nix`.
- Services (mail, monitoring, photos, etc.): see the keystone main repo's
  `modules/server/` for opt-in service modules.
- Desktop environment: `hosts/<name>/configuration.nix` can enable
  `keystone.desktop.enable = true;` for Hyprland + Walker.
- Day-to-day updates: `ks update` (relocks the consumer flake, rebuilds, and
  activates).
