# Keystone System Flake — declarative consumer-flake pointer.
#
# Declares the authoritative path to the consumer flake that produced the
# running NixOS system.  At activation time the resolved path is written to
# /run/current-system/keystone-system-flake (a plain file containing an
# absolute path followed by a newline).
#
# `ks update` and `ks switch` read that file as their single source of truth.
# The only accepted override is an explicit `ks --flake <path>` flag.
