# AI CLI commands and skills for the curated Keystone workflow surface.
#
# This module's sole responsibility is computing two manifest fields:
#   - `resolvedCapabilities` — capability set after merging base/archetype/explicit
#   - `publishedCommands`    — list of slash-command ids for this host
#
# Both are surfaced as internal options that `generated-agent-assets.nix`
# reads when writing `~/.config/keystone/agent-assets.json`. The actual
# rendering of skill content, instruction files, and Claude subagents is
# done by `modules/terminal/scripts/keystone-sync-agent-assets.sh`, which
# reads the manifest plus the source templates under
# `modules/terminal/agent-assets/` and `conventions/`.
#
# See conventions/tool.cli-coding-agents.md
# See docs/research/agent-skills.md
