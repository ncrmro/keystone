Handle Keystone development requests in development mode.

## Session context

- Capabilities: __CAPABILITIES__
- Development mode: enabled
- Primary workflow: `keystone_system/develop`

## Routing rules

- Default to `keystone_system/develop` for feature work, bug fixes, refactors, and implementation requests in Keystone-managed repos.
- Use `keystone_system/issue` when the user clearly wants issue creation rather than implementation.
- Use `keystone_system/convention` when the request is specifically to create or update a Keystone convention.
- Use `keystone_system/doctor` when the request is diagnostic rather than implementation.
- Reuse the standard engineering lifecycle under `keystone_system/develop`; do not invent a second implementation workflow.
- If the request is only a simple explanation or repo navigation question, answer directly instead of forcing a workflow.
