//! Why early-auth + lock-first?
//!
//! The previous order was build-then-prompt: the user clicked Walker →
//! Update and waited 1–2 minutes (silent nix build) before the polkit
//! dialog appeared. By that point the user had often context-switched
//! away and the dialog timed out (exit 127, "Not authorized"), so an
//! otherwise-clean run failed at the auth step. Today's order asks
//! permission first, surfaces a "Building…" notification immediately
//! after auth, and spends the cache window on actual work instead of
//! dead build time.
//!
//! In-sync invariant:
//!
//! Before any side effect, the consumer flake's working tree MUST be
//! clean and the current branch MUST equal `origin/<branch>`. The
//! supervised flow refuses to start otherwise. This buys us:
//!
//! - Rollback is unambiguous: the bump commit is always HEAD, has
//!   exactly one parent, and touches only `flake.lock`. A failure
//!   between commit and successful activation rewinds with
//!   `git reset --hard HEAD~1` after verifying HEAD == bump_sha.
//! - Comprehensibility: when the dialog refuses up front, the user
//!   sees one concrete reason ("ahead of origin", "behind origin",
//!   "uncommitted changes") instead of a partially-applied update
//!   that activated but couldn't push.
//!
//! Atomicity contract (lock-first with rollback on failure):
//!
//! 0. Pre-flight: ensure consumer flake is in sync with origin.
//! 1. Resolve target ref (no filesystem mutation).
//! 2. Warm the polkit credential via a no-op `ks activate
//!    <canonical(current)>`. We canonicalize `/run/current-system`
//!    first because `cmd::activate::validate_store_path` rejects
//!    arguments outside `/nix/store/` (defense-in-depth). The
//!    activation then short-circuits in `cmd::activate::execute`
//!    because the closure already matches current-system; only side
//!    effect is polkit caching the credential under `auth_admin_keep`
//!    for ~5 min.
//! 3. notify-send "Building <target>…" so the user has feedback during
//!    the build phase.
//! 4. Bump `flake.lock` (`nix flake update keystone --override-input
//!    keystone github:.../<rev>`) and commit it. Capture HEAD as
//!    `bump_sha`. NOT pushed yet.
//! 5. `nix build` against the consumer flake's
//!    `nixosConfigurations.<host>.config.system.build.toplevel`. The
//!    lock is correct, so no per-build `--override-input keystone`
//!    needed; local file-source overrides MAY still be layered.
//! 6. `ks activate <store-path>` via [`cmd::approve::run_and_wait`].
//!    The polkit cache from step 2 should cover this prompt; if it
//!    has expired, the user may be prompted again (degraded UX, not
//!    a failure).
//! 7. On activation success: `git push origin <branch>` (best-effort,
//!    soft fail), notify-send "complete".
//! 8. On any failure between steps 4 and 6 success:
//!    `rollback_lock_bump(bump_sha)` — verifies HEAD == bump_sha then
//!    `git reset --hard HEAD~1`. Refuses if HEAD diverged. notify-send
//!    "failed" with a journal pointer.
//!
//! Failure modes:
//!
//! - Step 0 fails → pre-flight refused to start. No side effects.
//! - Step 2 fails (user cancelled or auth failed) → consumer flake
//!   untouched. Next click retries from scratch.
//! - Steps 4 fails (lock update or commit) → working tree may have a
//!   modified `flake.lock` if the failure happened mid-step. The
//!   rollback path runs `git reset --hard HEAD` then a final
//!   `git checkout -- flake.lock` to restore clean state.
//! - Steps 5–6 fail → bump commit exists; rollback resets `HEAD~1`,
//!   leaving the consumer flake exactly as it was before the run.
//! - Step 6 succeeds, step 7 push fails → KEEP the bump commit. System
//!   is on the new closure, lock matches; only the remote is behind.
//!   User pushes by hand. This matches the previous best-effort push
//!   contract.
//!
//! Never confuse this code path with `cmd::update::update_locked`. That
//! is the terminal-only `ks update --lock` flow with full-fleet semantics
//! (pull all managed repos, deploy multiple hosts, sudo-cached
//! activation). This module is consumer-OS-style: one host, one channel
//! target, polkit-elevated activation.
