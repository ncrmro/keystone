# Keystone

Keystone enables self-sovereign infrastructure that you fully control, whether running on bare-metal hardware or cloud services. Unlike traditional infrastructure solutions, Keystone is designed for seamless migration between different environments while maintaining security, availability, and shared resource access.

## Core Principles

**Self-Sovereign Infrastructure**: Your infrastructure belongs to you. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit, with cryptographic keys under your control. Whether running on a Raspberry Pi in your home or a cloud VPS, you maintain full ownership and control.

**Declarative Configuration**: Everything is configured as code and can be managed in version control systems like Git. Define your desired infrastructure state once in configuration files, and Keystone maintains it across different hardware and network environments. This goes beyond traditional disaster recovery‚Äîit enables live migration of services between bare-metal and cloud infrastructure as needs change.

**Flexible Resource Sharing**: Share compute and storage resources within trusted groups (family, friends, business partners) while maintaining security boundaries and resource limits.

## Architecture: Servers and Clients

Keystone provides two primary types of infrastructure:

### Servers üñ•Ô∏è
**Always-on infrastructure that provides services**
- Network gateway, VPN endpoint, DNS server with ad/tracker blocking
- Storage server with redundant disks, backup destination, media server
- **Purpose**: Run 24/7, provide services to clients and external access
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, NUC, dedicated server, or VPS

### Clients üíª
**Interactive devices for daily computing**
- Desktop/laptop with development tools, user applications, desktop environment
- **Purpose**: Daily work, development, desktop computing that connects to server services
- **Hardware**: Laptop, desktop workstation, or any device for interactive use

### How They Work Together
- Clients connect to servers for backups, VPN access, shared storage
- Servers provide always-on services while clients can be powered down
- Both use the same security model (TPM, encryption, secure boot attestation)
- All devices automatically encrypt data and maintain cryptographic verification

## Common Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Home Server + Laptop
- **Server**: Raspberry Pi or NUC providing network services and storage
- **Client**: Laptop for daily computing
- **Use Case**: Home user with reliable home internet, wants network-wide ad blocking and secure remote access

### Pattern 2: VPS + Workstation  
- **Server**: Cloud VPS providing VPN and backup services
- **Client**: Desktop workstation with high-performance hardware
- **Use Case**: Remote work, need reliable external access point and backup destination

### Pattern 3: Complete Home Lab
- **Servers**: Multiple servers for different services and redundancy
- **Clients**: Multiple devices for family or team use
- **Use Case**: Family or small team with extensive home infrastructure needs

## Getting Started

### Quick Deployment to VM

Deploy a minimal Keystone server to a VM for testing:

```bash
# 1. Build ISO with SSH key
./bin/build-iso --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# 2. Boot VM from ISO and note its IP address

# 3. Configure your deployment in vms/test-server/configuration.nix
#    (see examples/test-server.nix for reference)

# 4. Deploy with automated wrapper
./scripts/deploy-vm.sh test-server <vm-ip> --verify

# OR deploy directly with nixos-anywhere
nixos-anywhere --flake .#test-server root@<vm-ip>

# 5. SSH into deployed server
ssh root@<vm-ip>
ssh root@test-server.local  # via mDNS
```

See `examples/test-server.nix` for a fully documented example configuration.

## Development & Testing

### VM Testing Workflow

Test Keystone ISOs quickly using automated VM workflows:

```bash
# Complete automated test (build ISO + launch VM + SSH)
make vm-test

# SSH into the VM
ssh -p 22220 root@localhost

# Stop the VM when done
make vm-stop

# Clean VM artifacts
make vm-clean
```

**Manual workflow** (step-by-step):
```bash
# 1. Build ISO with your SSH key
./bin/build-iso --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# 2. Launch VM
make vm-server

# 3. SSH into VM (wait ~30 seconds for boot)
ssh -p 22220 root@localhost

# 4. Stop VM
make vm-stop
```

**Available VM targets**:
- `make vm-test` - Build ISO and launch VM with automated SSH check
- `make vm-server` - Launch VM manually (requires pre-built ISO)
- `make vm-ssh` - Show SSH connection command
- `make vm-stop` - Stop running VM
- `make vm-clean` - Remove VM artifacts

**Requirements**: Install quickemu with `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.quickemu`

## Available Configurations

### Server Configuration
- Network gateway, VPN server, DNS with ad blocking, firewall management
- Storage server with ZFS, automated backups, media services
- Always-on services for clients and external access

### Client Configuration
