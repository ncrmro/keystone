# Shared-surface tracking

- For issue-backed work, post `Work Started` and `Work Update` comments on the source issue.
- Treat issues, pull requests, milestones, and boards as the canonical public record.
- Use notes for durable rationale and memory, not to replace shared-surface tracking.

# Commit format

- Use Conventional Commits: `type(scope): subject`.
- Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`.
- Each commit SHOULD represent one logical change.
