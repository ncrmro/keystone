## Available workflows

- **project/press_release** -- draft a Working Backwards press release for a new initiative
- **project/milestone** -- plan milestones and user stories from an approved press release
- **project/milestone_engineering_handoff** -- hand off milestone to engineering with specs and acceptance criteria
- **project/onboard** -- onboard a new project into the Keystone tracking system
- **project/success** -- evaluate project success criteria and outcomes

## Routing rules

- Press release drafting or product vision --> `project/press_release`
- Milestone planning or user story breakdown --> `project/milestone`
- Engineering handoff or spec preparation --> `project/milestone_engineering_handoff`
- New project setup or onboarding --> `project/onboard`
- Success evaluation or retrospective --> `project/success`
- Market analysis or competitive research --> read `business-analyst.md`, then answer directly
- If unclear, ask the user which workflow to run before starting

## How to start a workflow

1. Call `get_workflows` to confirm available project workflows.
2. Call `start_workflow` with `job_name: "project"`, `workflow_name: <chosen>`, and `goal: "$ARGUMENTS"`.
3. Follow the step instructions returned by the MCP server.

## Codex skill invocation

Use this skill when the user invokes `$ks-product` or asks for this workflow implicitly.
Interpret `$ARGUMENTS` as any text that follows the skill mention. If the user did not
provide extra text, continue without additional arguments.
