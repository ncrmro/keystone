# Example: TPM Enrollment Configuration
#
# This example shows how to enable TPM enrollment for automatic disk unlock
# on a Keystone system.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Deploy this configuration with nixos-anywhere
#   2. Boot the system and log in
#   3. Run: sudo keystone-enroll-recovery
#   4. Save the recovery key securely
#   5. Reboot to test automatic TPM unlock
