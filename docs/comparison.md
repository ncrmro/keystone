## keystone.terminal Cross-Platform

The `keystone.terminal` module is a Home Manager module — it configures your shell,
editor, multiplexer, Git, AI tools, and PIM stack declaratively. Because Home Manager
runs in userspace, it works anywhere Nix runs.

### NixOS (native)

Full integration. The terminal module is applied via `home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager`
inside your NixOS configuration. Everything works out of the box including hardware key
support, system-level agent integration, and service coordination.

```nix
# In your NixOS flake
home-manager.users.you = {
  imports = [ keystone.homeModules.terminal ];
  keystone.terminal.enable = true;
};
```

### Ubuntu / Other Linux

Install Nix as a package manager (multi-user mode), then use standalone Home Manager.
You get the full terminal experience — shell, editor, tools — without replacing your OS.

```bash
# Install Nix
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon

# Install Home Manager standalone
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update
nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
```

Then import `keystone.homeModules.terminal` in your `~/.config/home-manager/flake.nix`.

### macOS

Use nix-darwin for system-level Nix integration, plus Home Manager for user config.
Most terminal tools work identically. Desktop modules are not available on macOS.

```bash
# Install Nix
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)

# Install nix-darwin + Home Manager
# Then import keystone.homeModules.terminal in your darwin flake
```

### Windows (WSL2)

Run a WSL2 Linux distribution, install Nix inside it, then use Home Manager standalone.
The terminal module works fully within the WSL2 environment.

```powershell
# Enable WSL2 and install a distro (e.g., Ubuntu)
wsl --install

# Inside WSL2, install Nix and Home Manager as described in the Linux section
```

### Omarchy (Arch-based)

Omarchy already uses Hyprland, so the desktop experience is similar. Install Nix as a
package manager on Arch, then use standalone Home Manager to get the keystone terminal
stack alongside Omarchy's existing config.

```bash
# Install Nix on Arch
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon

# Use standalone Home Manager with keystone.homeModules.terminal
```

## What You Get

Regardless of platform, `keystone.terminal` provides:

- **Shell**: Zsh with custom prompt, completions, and aliases
- **Editor**: Helix with LSP configurations
- **Multiplexer**: Zellij with custom layouts
- **Git**: SSH signing, custom aliases, forge integrations
- **AI tools**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other coding agents
- **PIM**: Email (Himalaya), calendar, contacts, tasks — all terminal-based
