## Platform Overview

### Keystone OS Agents

Agents are first-class NixOS user accounts with their own UID, home directory, SSH keys,
git signing identity, email, headless desktop, and browser. Each agent is declared in a
Nix flake and gets systemd-managed services for task execution, note syncing, and
scheduling. The `agentctl` CLI provides unified management across all agents.

Key differentiators:
- **OS-level identity** — agents are real users, not sandboxed processes
- **Full communication stack** — each agent has its own email, calendar, and contacts
- **Declarative everything** — agent config is reproducible Nix, not imperative setup
- **ZFS persistence** — agent home directories survive reboots with snapshot rollback
- **Headless desktop** — labwc + wayvnc gives agents a real Wayland session for browser automation

### OpenClaw

An open-source Node.js agent framework with a skill-based architecture. Skills are
modular capabilities (file editing, web browsing, API calls) composed via YAML/JSON
configuration. Runs as a single process on any OS. Good for building custom agent
workflows but lacks OS-level identity and isolation.

### Devin (Cognition)

A cloud-hosted autonomous coding agent with a full Linux VM environment including
desktop, terminal, and browser. Excels at end-to-end feature development but requires
a SaaS subscription with no self-hosting option. The 2.0 release added multi-agent
support for parallel task execution.

### Sculptor (Imbue)

An open-source agent runtime using Docker containers for isolation. Each agent runs in
its own container with configurable tools and environment. Supports parallel execution
via container orchestration. Self-hostable but limited to container-level isolation
without OS-level identity features.

### Claude Code

Anthropic's CLI tool for interactive coding assistance. Runs in the user's terminal
with access to the user's files and environment. Supports worktree-based parallel
agents and MCP server integration. Powerful for assisted development but operates
as a transient process without persistent identity or scheduling.

### Codex (OpenAI)

OpenAI's coding agent available as both a CLI tool and cloud-hosted sandbox. The CLI
mode runs locally with user credentials; cloud mode provides isolated sandboxes for
parallel execution. Limited to OpenAI models with no self-hosting for the cloud
component.

## When to Use What
