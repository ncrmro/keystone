# Research Event Options

## Objective

Research venues, catering, and logistics options that match the event requirements, presenting each with enough detail for the user to make a decision.

## Task

Using the event requirements document, search for and evaluate options across venues, catering, and logistics providers. Present a curated shortlist with pros, cons, and cost estimates.

### Process

1. **Read the requirements document**
   - Parse all constraints: budget, location, capacity, dietary needs, equipment
   - Note hard constraints vs. nice-to-haves

2. **Research venue options**
   - Use WebSearch to find venues matching location and capacity requirements
   - Identify 3-5 venue options at different price points
   - For each venue, gather: name, address, capacity, estimated cost, amenities, availability

3. **Research catering options**
   - Search for caterers in the target area or venues with in-house catering
   - Match to dietary restrictions and meal type requirements
   - Get estimated per-person pricing

4. **Identify logistics needs**
   - Transportation (parking, shuttle services)
   - Accommodation options if needed
   - AV rental if not included with venue

5. **Compile options with evaluation**
   - Rate each option against the requirements
   - Note pros and cons for each
   - Flag any that exceed budget or miss key requirements
