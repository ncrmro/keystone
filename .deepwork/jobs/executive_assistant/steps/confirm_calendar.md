# Confirm Calendar

## Objective

Verify that all planned calendar changes were applied correctly and produce a final summary of the calendar's state.

## Task

Cross-reference the changes log against the actual calendar to confirm everything is in order. Produce a clean summary of the final calendar state.

### Process

1. **Read the changes log**
   - Parse calendar_changes.md for all changes that were applied
   - Note any that failed or were skipped

2. **Verify changes**
   - Re-check the calendar to confirm each change took effect
   - Verify invitation delivery where possible
   - Flag any discrepancies between planned and actual state

3. **Produce final summary**
   - Show the updated calendar for the period
   - Highlight what changed from the original snapshot
   - Note any remaining issues or follow-up items

## Output Format

### calendar_summary.md

Final calendar summary confirming all changes are in place.

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Calendar Summary

- **Period**: [date range]
- **Changes Verified**: [count of count]
- **Status**: [all clear / issues remaining]

## Verification Results
