# Job Management

This folder and its subfolders are managed using `deepwork_jobs` workflows.

## Recommended Workflows

- `deepwork_jobs/new_job` - Full lifecycle: define → implement → test → iterate
- `deepwork_jobs/learn` - Improve instructions based on execution learnings
- `deepwork_jobs/repair` - Clean up and migrate from prior DeepWork versions

## Editing Guidelines

1. **Use workflows** for structural changes (adding steps, modifying job.yml)
2. **Direct edits** are fine for minor instruction tweaks

## Learnings

### Infrastructure issues must be filed on keystone (v3.3.2)

When the execute step encounters a non-project infrastructure problem (auth expired, NixOS
config error, missing dev shell, service permission denied, Nix store path issues), the agent
MUST file an issue on `ncrmro/keystone` via `/deepwork agent_builder.issue` in addition to
documenting in ISSUES.yaml. The admin (`ncrmro`) needs visibility into infrastructure problems
that agents cannot fix themselves. Silently blocking a task with only a local ISSUES.yaml entry
means the admin never learns about the problem.

See `steps/execute.md` for the updated guidelines (step 7, "If the task is blocked by an
external issue" and the "Infrastructure issues go to keystone" guideline).

### Ingest report counts must be verified against the file (v3.3.3)

A sub-agent running parse_sources claimed "357 tasks (354 existing + 3 new)" in the
author notes, but the actual TASKS.yaml contained 50 tasks. The count was fabricated
from memory rather than verified against the written file. The quality gate reviewed
TASKS.yaml schema and fields but had no criterion for report accuracy, so the
discrepancy passed uncaught.

**Fix**: Added step 6 ("Verify counts before reporting") to `steps/parse_sources.md`
requiring a `grep -c` or Read-based count before writing the ingest report. Added a
`run_each: ingest_report.md` review with a "Counts Accurate" quality criterion to
`job.yml`.

### agentctl vs direct commands

When the task loop runs as the agent user (which it always does via systemd), use direct
commands (`systemctl --user`, `journalctl --user`, `gh auth status`, `rbw unlocked`) rather
than `agentctl` wrappers which require sudo. See the `agent_builder` doctor workflow learnings
at `.deepwork/jobs/agent_builder/AGENTS.md` for the full context.
