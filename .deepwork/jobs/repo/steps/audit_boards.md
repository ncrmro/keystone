# Audit Boards

## Objective

Full board audit: add missing items, correct wrong statuses, flag stale cards. For Forgejo, output manual instructions.

## Prerequisite

Requires `platform_context.md` and `milestones_audit.md`. Board audit depends on milestone audit because it needs accurate milestone-issue mappings.

## Task

### Process

1. **Handle Forgejo early exit**
   - If platform is Forgejo (`boards_api: false`), output manual review instructions:
     - How to check boards in the web UI at `https://git.ncrmro.com/{owner}/{repo}/projects`
     - Checklist of things to verify manually
     - Skip all CLI automation steps below

2. **For each open milestone with a board:**

   a. **Fetch board items**
      ```bash
      gh project item-list {project_number} --owner {owner} --format json
      ```

   b. **Fetch milestone issues**
      ```bash
      gh issue list --repo {owner}/{repo} --milestone "{milestone}" --state all \
        --json number,title,state,labels
      ```

   c. **Find missing items** — milestone issues not on the board
      - Add missing items:
        ```bash
        gh project item-add {project_number} --owner {owner} \
          --url https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number} \
          --format json
        ```

   d. **Cross-reference statuses** — for each board item:
      - Check linked issue state and PR state
      - Expected status rules:
        - Closed issue → Done
        - Open + non-draft PR with reviewers → In Review
        - Open + draft PR or any open PR → In Progress
        - Open + no PR → Backlog
      - Correct wrong statuses:
        ```bash
        gh project item-edit --id {item_id} --project-id {project_id} \
          --field-id {status_field_id} \
          --single-select-option-id {correct_option_id}
        ```

   e. **Find stale cards** — board items whose linked issue is NOT in the milestone
      - Flag but do NOT auto-remove

3. **For milestones without boards:**
   - Flag as missing
   - Optionally create if there are issues to track (ask user or just report)

## Output Format
