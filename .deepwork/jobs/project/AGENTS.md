# Job Management

This folder and its subfolders are managed using `deepwork_jobs` workflows.

## Recommended Workflows

- `deepwork_jobs/new_job` - Full lifecycle: define → implement → test → iterate
- `deepwork_jobs/learn` - Improve instructions based on execution learnings
- `deepwork_jobs/repair` - Clean up and migrate from prior DeepWork versions

## Learning History

### 2026-03-20: Press release tone — succinct, no quotes, no city

- **Source**: User feedback after running `project/press_release` workflow
- **Issue**: Press releases were too verbose with marketing-style prose. They included fictional customer quotes (fabricated testimonials) and city datelines that the user didn't want. The tone should be direct and informational.
- **Resolution**: Three changes applied to `steps/write_press_release.md` and `steps/gather_context.md`:
  1. Removed customer quote requirement from both steps and the context brief template
  2. Removed city dateline from the template — only include if user explicitly requests
  3. Restructured body to a succinct flow: current state → why this → how → what. Word count reduced from 400-600 to 300-500.
- **Reference**: `steps/write_press_release.md` (template and quality criteria), `steps/gather_context.md` (removed quote direction), `job.yml` common_job_info and write_press_release reviews

### 2026-03-20: Press releases must include ASCII art mockups

- **Source**: User feedback on Desktop Context System press release (#174) — lacked a visual showing the context switcher UI
- **Issue**: Press releases for products with a UI shipped without showing what the product looks like in use. An ASCII art mockup grounds the reader and makes the promise concrete.
- **Resolution**: Added ASCII art mockup as a required step in `steps/write_press_release.md` (step 6). Added mockup section to the template. Added "ASCII Art Mockup" quality criterion to `job.yml` write_press_release reviews. Products without a UI may omit the mockup.
- **Reference**: `steps/write_press_release.md` step 6 and template, `job.yml` write_press_release reviews

### 2026-03-21: Press releases must create an issue and output the full URL

- **Source**: User feedback after running `project/press_release` workflow for Keystone perception layer
- **Issue**: The workflow produced only a local `.mdx` file but did not create an issue or provide a URL. Downstream workflows (e.g., `milestone/setup`) need a stable, linkable reference to the press release for traceability.
- **Resolution**: Three changes applied:
  1. Added step 10 to `steps/write_press_release.md` — create an issue on the project repo with the press release content and record the full URL
  2. Added `press_release_issue_url.md` as a required output in `job.yml` with its own quality review
  3. Updated `common_job_info` to mandate issue creation and URL output
- **Reference**: `steps/write_press_release.md` step 10, `job.yml` write_press_release outputs and reviews

### 2026-03-25: Stage press release workflow artifacts under `.deepwork/tmp/`

- **Source**: User feedback after running `project/press_release` for `keystone.development`
- **Issue**: The workflow instructions were clear about the published issue, but ambiguous about the local output path. That allowed the run to use ad hoc `/tmp/...` files even though this repo's DeepWork convention is to keep transient workflow artifacts under `.deepwork/tmp/`.
- **Resolution**: Updated `steps/write_press_release.md` and `job.yml` so the workflow now stages `press_release.mdx` and `press_release_issue_url.md` under `.deepwork/tmp/`. The instructions now distinguish transient local artifacts from canonical publication: the GitHub/Forgejo issue is always published, and `posts/press_releases/` is only used when the project explicitly stores press releases in-repo.
- **Reference**: `steps/write_press_release.md` output format and publication steps, `job.yml` common_job_info

### 2026-03-30: Press releases must be stored in ~/notes before creating the issue

- **Source**: User instruction — all project press releases must first be stored in `~/notes` following the zk tagging standard
- **Issue**: The workflow created an issue and a local `.deepwork/tmp/` artifact but did not create a durable zk note in the user's notes notebook. Press releases are meaningful project records that should be discoverable alongside other project notes.
- **Resolution**: Added step 11 to `steps/write_press_release.md` — create a permanent note in `~/notes/notes/` before creating the issue. The note must include `project/<slug>`, `source/agent`, `source/deepwork` tags, and `repo_ref` frontmatter. After issue creation, the note must be updated with `issue_ref`. If a project hub exists in `~/notes/index/`, the note must be linked from it. Updated `job.yml` common_job_info to mandate the zk note step.
- **Reference**: `steps/write_press_release.md` steps 11–12 and Output Format, `job.yml` common_job_info press release conventions, `process.notes`, `tool.zk-notes`

### 2026-03-30: Press release tmp artifacts must use unique filenames

- **Source**: User feedback after running `project/press_release` for Keystone Project Agent
- **Issue**: The workflow correctly staged local artifacts under `.deepwork/tmp/`, but it still used generic basenames like `press_release.mdx` and `press_release_issue_url.md`. Re-running the workflow for another project or another press release can overwrite earlier artifacts and confuse traceability.
- **Resolution**: Updated `steps/write_press_release.md` and `job.yml` to require unique `.deepwork/tmp/` filenames derived from the project slug or headline slug, such as `<slug>-press-release.mdx` and `<slug>-press-release-issue-url.md`. Added a review criterion to reject shared generic basenames.
- **Reference**: `steps/write_press_release.md` final check, staging instructions, output format, and `job.yml` press_release review criteria

### 2026-03-30: Press release issues should quote the release text

- **Source**: User feedback after reviewing the published press release issue
- **Issue**: The workflow created the issue with the press release as plain body text. The user wants the actual user-facing press release to appear as quoted published copy, so readers can clearly distinguish the release from any issue wrapper text.
- **Resolution**: Updated `steps/write_press_release.md` and `job.yml` so the issue body must render the press release inside a Markdown blockquote (`>` on each release line). Added review criteria to reject plain pasted issue bodies.
- **Reference**: `steps/write_press_release.md` publish step and quality criteria, `job.yml` press_release issue review

### 2026-03-30: Press release issue structure — blockquote, internal context, user stories

- **Source**: User feedback after reviewing the published press release for Keystone Project Agent (#260)
- **Issues identified**:
  1. The `**Current state**` / `**Why this**` / `**How**` / `**What**` labels appeared inside the `>` blockquote. These are internal draft scaffolding — they belong **outside** the blockquote in the issue body, below the `---` separator, where the development team can read them.
  2. The `>` blockquote (the audience-facing section) must be clean narrative prose — headline, paragraphs, ASCII mockup, CTA — with no internal labels visible.
  3. The `gather_context` step did not proactively ask clarifying questions. The workflow should always ask scoping questions (who is the customer, what is the one problem, what is in/out of scope, what is the CTA) before researching or drafting. A vaguely scoped idea produces a vague press release.
  4. The press release issue was missing user stories. The issue body (outside the blockquote) must include 3-5 user stories derived from the press release scope.
- **Resolution**:
  1. `steps/gather_context.md`: Added step 1 requiring the agent to always ask 6 scoping questions and wait for answers before proceeding
  2. `steps/write_press_release.md` Output Format: Updated issue body template to show four parts: `>` blockquote → internal context (current state/why/how/what) → user stories → FAQ
  3. `steps/write_press_release.md` Quality Criteria: Added criteria for internal context sections and user stories appearing outside the blockquote
- **Reference**: `steps/gather_context.md` step 1, `steps/write_press_release.md` Output Format and Quality Criteria

## Editing Guidelines

1. **Use workflows** for structural changes (adding steps, modifying job.yml)
2. **Direct edits** are fine for minor instruction tweaks
