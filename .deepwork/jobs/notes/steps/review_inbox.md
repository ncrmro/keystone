# Review Inbox

## Objective

List all fleeting notes in `inbox/`, read each, and classify them for promotion or discard.

## Task

1. List all notes in inbox:
   ```bash
   zk list inbox/ --format json
   ```

2. If inbox is empty, report "Inbox empty — nothing to process" and output an empty classification.

3. For each note, read its content and classify:
   - **promote-to-permanent**: Contains a standalone idea worth preserving as an atomic note
   - **promote-to-literature**: Summarizes or references an external source
   - **discard**: Stale, duplicate, or no longer relevant
   - **keep**: Not ready to process yet (needs more thought)

4. For promotable notes, draft a brief target title and suggested tags.

## Output Format

Write `inbox_review.md`:

```markdown
# Inbox Review
