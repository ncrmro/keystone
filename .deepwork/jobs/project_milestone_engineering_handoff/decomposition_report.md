## Phased Dependency Graph

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (parallel — no dependencies)
- #110 chore: projects module scaffold
- #111 chore: pz package
- #115 chore: pclaude package

### Phase 2: Core Sessions (parallel — depends on Phase 1)
- #112 feat: pz create/attach (depends on #110, #111)
- #113 feat: pz list (depends on #111)
- #114 chore: pz completions (depends on #110, #111)

### Phase 3: Agent Launcher (depends on Phase 1)
- #116 feat: pclaude basic (depends on #110, #115)
- #117 feat: pclaude worktree (depends on #116)
- #118 feat: pclaude prompt/resume (depends on #116)

### Phase 4: Container Agents (depends on Phase 3, lower priority)
- #119 feat: AGENT.md generation (depends on #118)
- #120 feat: pz agent subcommands (depends on #119, #111)

## Coverage Matrix

| User Story | Child Issues |
|-----------|-------------|
| US-001: Create named terminal sessions | #110, #111, #112, #114 |
| US-002: Resume existing sessions | #110, #111, #112 |
| US-003: List sessions by project | #111, #113 |
| US-004: Launch sub-agent in worktrees | #110, #115, #116, #117, #118 |
| US-005: Manage sub-agents in containers | #119, #120 |

## Future Work (out of milestone scope)
- Desktop integration: Walker plugin and Hyprland menu for project launch (REQ-010.18–010.20)
- Inter-agent communication between container sub-agents
- GPU passthrough for ML-focused archetypes
- Archetype marketplace for sharing across projects

## Statistics
- **Total issues**: 11
- **Infrastructure (chore)**: 4
- **Features (feat)**: 7
- **Tests (test)**: 0 (tests are included within feat issues per acceptance criteria)
- **Avg files per issue**: 2-3

## Notes
- No separate `test:` issues were created because each feature issue includes testable acceptance criteria. Integration tests can be added as a follow-up if needed.
- US-004 was split into 3 issues (basic, worktree, prompt/resume) per the scope analysis recommendation, allowing incremental delivery.
- US-005 was split into 2 issues (AGENT.md generation, CLI subcommands) — the archetype system design (scope analysis ambiguity #1) should be resolved during #119 implementation.
- All features are gated behind `keystone.projects.enable` — no separate feature flags needed.
- Phase 2 and Phase 3 can run in parallel since they share no code dependencies (pz vs pclaude).
